# CrewAI Memory System Integration

## Overview

The MultiRoleAgent now includes CrewAI's sophisticated memory system that enables natural follow-up conversations without hardcoding follow-up logic. This is similar to LangGraph's MemorySaver but with additional capabilities.

## Memory System Components

### 1. **Short-Term Memory**
- Temporarily stores recent interactions using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Enables agents to recall information relevant to current context
- Perfect for handling follow-up questions within the same conversation

### 2. **Long-Term Memory**
- Preserves valuable insights and learnings from past executions
- Uses SQLite3 to store task results across sessions
- Allows agents to build knowledge over time

### 3. **Entity Memory**
- Captures and organizes information about entities (altitude, battery, GPS, etc.)
- Uses RAG for storing entity relationships and characteristics
- Facilitates deeper understanding of UAV flight patterns

### 4. **Contextual Memory**
- Combines all memory types for coherent responses
- Maintains context across conversation sequences
- Enables natural reference resolution ("that altitude", "those errors", etc.)

## Implementation Details

### Memory Configuration

```python
def _setup_memory_configuration(self):
    """Configure CrewAI memory system for persistent conversation context."""
    # Custom storage directory
    self.memory_storage_dir = os.getenv("CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR", "./crewai_memory")
    os.makedirs(self.memory_storage_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Embedding configuration for semantic search
    self.memory_embedder_config = {
        "provider": "openai",
        "config": {
            "api_key": self.settings.openai_api_key,
            "model": "text-embedding-3-small"  # Cost-effective option
        }
    }
```

### Crew Integration

Each Crew instance now includes memory:

```python
planning_crew = Crew(
    agents=[planner_agent],
    tasks=[planning_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True,
    memory=True,                          # Enable memory system
    embedder=self.memory_embedder_config  # Custom embedder config
)
```

## Benefits for UAV Log Analysis

### 1. **Natural Follow-up Questions**
```
User: "What was the maximum altitude?"
Bot: "Maximum altitude reached was 1,448 meters..."

User: "How does that compare to typical flights?"  # ← Memory understands "that"
Bot: "The 1,448m altitude is significantly higher than typical..."
```

### 2. **Context-Aware Analysis**
```
User: "Analyze power consumption"
Bot: "Battery temperature averaged 0.0°C..."

User: "What about during high altitude phases?"  # ← Remembers power discussion
Bot: "During the high altitude phase at 1,448m, power consumption..."
```

### 3. **Cross-Session Learning**
- Remembers common flight patterns across different log files
- Builds understanding of normal vs. anomalous behavior
- Learns user preferences for analysis depth and style

## Storage Structure

The memory system creates the following directory structure:

```
./crewai_memory/
├── knowledge/           # Knowledge base ChromaDB files
├── short_term_memory/   # Short-term memory ChromaDB files  
├── long_term_memory/    # Long-term memory ChromaDB files
├── entities/            # Entity memory ChromaDB files
└── long_term_memory_storage.db  # SQLite database
```

## API Methods

### Memory Information
```python
memory_info = agent.get_memory_info()
# Returns:
# {
#     "storage_directory": "./crewai_memory",
#     "memory_enabled": True,
#     "embedder_provider": "openai",
#     "embedder_model": "text-embedding-3-small",
#     "memory_types": ["short_term", "long_term", "entity"],
#     "storage_exists": True,
#     "storage_size_mb": 2.5
# }
```

### Memory Reset
```python
# Reset all memory
agent.reset_memory()

# Reset for specific session (placeholder for future enhancement)
agent.reset_memory(session_id="specific_session")
```

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Custom storage location
export CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR="/path/to/custom/memory"

# OpenAI API key for embeddings
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
```

### Embedder Providers

The system supports multiple embedding providers:

```python
# OpenAI (default)
embedder_config = {
    "provider": "openai",
    "config": {"model": "text-embedding-3-small"}
}

# Ollama (local)
embedder_config = {
    "provider": "ollama",
    "config": {"model": "mxbai-embed-large"}
}

# Google AI
embedder_config = {
    "provider": "google",
    "config": {"model": "text-embedding-004"}
}
```

## Example Conversation Flow

### Before Memory System:
```
User: "What was the maximum altitude?"
Bot: "Maximum altitude was 1,448m"

User: "Tell me more about that"  # ← Bot doesn't understand "that"
Bot: "Could you be more specific about what you'd like to know?"
```

### With Memory System:
```
User: "What was the maximum altitude?"
Bot: "Maximum altitude was 1,448m during cruise phase"

User: "Tell me more about that"  # ← Memory resolves "that" to altitude
Bot: "The 1,448m altitude was maintained for 12 minutes during cruise..."

User: "Any issues during that phase?"  # ← Understands "that phase"
Bot: "During the high altitude cruise phase, GPS signal quality dropped to..."
```

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify memory functionality:

```bash
cd backend
python test_memory_system.py
```

This will show:
- Memory configuration status
- Storage location and structure
- Example conversation flows that benefit from memory
- Key benefits and capabilities

## Performance Considerations

1. **Storage Growth**: Memory files will grow over time. Monitor `storage_size_mb` in memory info.

2. **Embedding Costs**: Using OpenAI embeddings incurs API costs. Consider local alternatives like Ollama for high-volume usage.

3. **Search Performance**: RAG searches are optimized but may slow with very large memory stores.

## Migration from V2ConversationSession

The existing conversation history in `V2ConversationSession` is preserved and works alongside CrewAI memory:

- **V2ConversationSession**: Stores raw message history for the current session
- **CrewAI Memory**: Provides semantic search and cross-session persistence
- **Combined**: Offers both immediate context and long-term learning

## Troubleshooting

### Memory Not Working
1. Check OpenAI API key is set
2. Verify `memory=True` is set in Crew initialization
3. Check storage directory permissions
4. Review logs for memory-related errors

### Storage Issues
1. Check disk space in storage directory
2. Verify write permissions
3. Consider resetting memory if corrupted: `agent.reset_memory()`

### Performance Issues
1. Monitor memory storage size
2. Consider using local embeddings (Ollama)
3. Implement periodic memory cleanup if needed

## Future Enhancements

1. **Session-Specific Memory**: Implement per-session memory isolation
2. **Memory Summarization**: Compress old memories to manage storage
3. **Custom Memory Queries**: Direct memory search API
4. **Memory Analytics**: Usage statistics and insights
5. **Memory Export/Import**: Backup and restore capabilities

## Conclusion

The CrewAI memory system transforms the MultiRoleAgent from a stateless analyzer to an intelligent assistant that learns and remembers. This enables natural, contextual conversations about UAV flight data without the need for complex follow-up logic hardcoding.

The system is production-ready and will automatically improve conversation quality as it learns from user interactions and flight data patterns.
